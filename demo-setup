# In order to use gallery, you must use the UPS setup command to make the
# appropriate packages active. The appropriate packages include those defined
# by your experiment and which provide the ROOT dictionaries for the data
# products in the file you are going to read.
#
# This example uses the product larsoftobj, which provides the dictionaries for
# all of the LArSoft data products. Setting up larsoftobj also sets up the
# appropriate version of gallery itself.
#
# If you need to install a bundle of product, you can use the pullProducts
# script to do so. An example of how to do that for larsoftobj version 1.08.01
# is shown below. Please use the product name and version appropriate for your
# experiment.
#
#     -- get the pullProducts script, and make it executable
# wget http://scisoft.fnal.gov/scisoft/bundles/tools/pullProducts
# chmod +x pullProducts
#     -- use pullProducts to install larsoftobj (and all of its dependencies)
#     -- under $HOME/products
#     -- Note that <platform> should be one of u14, d14, d15, slf6, slf7
# ./pullProducts $HOME/products <platform> larsoftobj-v1_08_02 e10 prof

# Adjust the next line, if necessary, to reflect the location into
# which you have installed the products.
